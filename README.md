# runtime-deps
A project I made in a few hours, which allows you to (down)load Maven dependencies (and their sub-dependencies) at runtime.

# Disclaimer
This project is no longer maintained since it's not actually viable. This may reduce JAR files size, but sub-dependency resolution makes it very hard 
to run applications fastly.
